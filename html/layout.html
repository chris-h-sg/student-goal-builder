                <strong>Welcome to the report writer!</strong>

                <p>
                    I developed this tool to make report writing easier and less time-consuming, while still flexible
                    enough to create personal, individualized comments. The comments are closely tied to standards and
                    expectations for children in the first grade, but should be useful for grades K-2. They are
                    organized by subject and, in some cases, subtopics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I'm writing reports, I generally consider the following points and use them in writing and
                    organizing the comments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the student's general attitude towards learning the subject?</li>
                    <li>In general, how well are they meeting grade-level expectations? Do they need support, or exceed
                        expectations?
                    </li>
                    <li>Which standards are they meeting and/or developing?</li>
                    <li>What goals have I identified for future learning?</li>
                    <li>What supporting details and anecdotal evidence can I provide?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The source material for these comments comes from narrative reports I've written in the past, Common
                    Core and AERO standards, IB PYP language, and professional literature such as Fountas and Pinnell.
                </p>

                <strong>How to use:</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>On the right side, enter the student's name and gender. The student's name will appear once in
                        each paragraph, and thereafter the correct gender will be automatically applied.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click the comments that apply for each subject area. A paragraph will be generated in the box on
                        the right. If you decide not to use a comment you already selected, click on the box again and
                        it will be deleted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The character and word counts show how many characters and words you've used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you're ready, cut and paste the paragraph into your report document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may want to edit some of the comments after you cut and paste them, so that the writing is
                        fluid and paints a picture of a specific child. It was important to me that the comments could
                        be edited to provide supporting details, and that is why some sentences contain blanks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
